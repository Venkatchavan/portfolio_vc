My research project, conducted during my Master&#39;s at SRH Berlin, explored this frontier.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I experimented with different approaches:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Effective at identifying complex visual features but limited in grasping abstract reasoning.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Good for structured classification tasks but struggled with abstraction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object &amp; Emotion Classifiers: Explored linking abstract ideas (like emotions) with contextual data to push AI toward higher-level reasoning.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Key takeaways included:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Guiding AI with expert feedback improves contextual understanding.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Explainable AI (XAI): Crucial for trust, especially in domains like healthcare and law.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MLOps &amp; Concept Drift: Continuous retraining is vital since meanings of abstract concepts evolve with society.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer: Models can learn fairness in one domain (education) and apply it in another (healthcare).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultimately, this research underscored that building cognitive architectures combining neural and symbolic reasoning is essential for AI to approach human-like abstraction.">

This study focused on how Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), when paired with event-driven trading strategies, can give traders a competitive edge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How OSINT Powers Trading:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Real-Time Market Insights: Social media, news, and financial reports act as early warning signals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sentiment Analysis: By applying NLP to Twitter and news data, we quantified market mood—positive or negative—and linked it to price movements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Event Detection: Machine learning techniques helped identify significant political, economic, or cultural events affecting markets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Case Study – Cricket T20 World Cup 2024: India&#39;s win triggered positive sentiment on social media, which aligned with short-term market movement in related sectors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Challenges &amp; Ethics:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Data Reliability: Not all public data is accurate—misinformation can mislead strategies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Privacy Concerns: Using social media data requires strict ethical compliance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Algorithm + Human Fusion: The best outcomes came when AI tools worked alongside human analysts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Future Outlook:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the rise of AI-powered sentiment analysis, rare event detection, and high-frequency trading models, OSINT will continue reshaping how investors navigate markets. Beyond finance, OSINT is also proving its value in cybersecurity, crisis monitoring, and geopolitical risk analysis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;👉 Together, these two works reflect my dual focus: pushing the boundaries of AI cognition and applying data-driven intelligence to real-world decision-making.">
