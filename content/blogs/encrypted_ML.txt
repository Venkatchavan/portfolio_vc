Encrypted Vector Operations for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

As AI systems grow more powerful, they also grow hungrier for data often sensitive data. From healthcare diagnostics to biometric authentication, sharing raw information with third parties creates serious privacy risks. This is where Encrypted Vector Operations come in a technique that allows computations directly on encrypted data, ensuring that privacy is never compromised.

üß† The Idea Behind It

The core of this research lies in Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), specifically using the Paillier cryptosystem. Unlike traditional encryption, PHE enables certain operations (like addition or multiplication) to be performed on encrypted data meaning data can stay encrypted throughout the process.

This makes it possible to compute dot products, cosine similarities, and Euclidean distances securely the backbone operations behind machine learning tasks like classification, clustering, and recommendation systems.

üîç Why It Matters

Most current privacy-preserving ML models rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) which, while secure, is computationally expensive and slow. The PHE-based approach provides a sweet spot between security and efficiency, making real-world applications feasible without sacrificing performance.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Client: Encrypts the input (query) vectors using Paillier encryption.

Server: Performs similarity computations on encrypted data never accessing plaintext values.

Client: Decrypts the final results.

This ensures end-to-end confidentiality while maintaining analytical functionality.

üìà Key Findings

Accuracy: Encrypted operations achieved identical accuracy to plaintext computations.

Efficiency: Computational overhead increased only by 6‚Äì8√ó, a manageable trade-off for strong privacy.

Storage: Encrypted data required around 32√ó more storage, typical for homomorphic systems.

Scalability: Works effectively for datasets up to 1024-dimensional vectors.

üè• Real-World Applications

Healthcare: Compute patient similarity for diagnosis without exposing records.

Biometrics: Perform secure fingerprint or iris matching without revealing templates.

Recommender Systems: Enable privacy-safe personalization.

Federated Learning: Aggregate model updates securely across distributed systems.

üöÄ The Bigger Picture

This study proves that privacy and performance can coexist. By integrating PHE-based encrypted vector operations, we can build AI systems that respect data privacy by design.

Future directions include:

Combining PHE with lattice-based or post-quantum encryption for stronger resilience.

Optimizing through parallel processing and hardware acceleration.

Expanding toward hybrid cryptosystems for broader machine learning support.

üß© Conclusion

Partially Homomorphic Encryption offers a practical, scalable, and secure foundation for privacy-preserving machine learning. It enables safe computation on encrypted vectors, balancing accuracy and efficiency paving the way for the next generation of secure, trustworthy AI.
