ðŸ“— Blog 2: Event-Driven Strategies Using OSINT

Based on my OSINT Academic Paper

Financial markets don't just respond to numbersâ€”they respond to events and emotions. This study focused on how Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), when paired with event-driven trading strategies, can give traders a competitive edge.

How OSINT Powers Trading:

Real-Time Market Insights: Social media, news, and financial reports act as early warning signals.

Sentiment Analysis: By applying NLP to Twitter and news data, we quantified market moodâ€”positive or negativeâ€”and linked it to price movements.

Event Detection: Machine learning techniques helped identify significant political, economic, or cultural events affecting markets.

Case Study â€“ Cricket T20 World Cup 2024: India's win triggered positive sentiment on social media, which aligned with short-term market movement in related sectors.

Challenges & Ethics:

Data Reliability: Not all public data is accurateâ€”misinformation can mislead strategies.

Privacy Concerns: Using social media data requires strict ethical compliance.

Algorithm + Human Fusion: The best outcomes came when AI tools worked alongside human analysts.

Future Outlook:

With the rise of AI-powered sentiment analysis, rare event detection, and high-frequency trading models, OSINT will continue reshaping how investors navigate markets. Beyond finance, OSINT is also proving its value in cybersecurity, crisis monitoring, and geopolitical risk analysis.

ðŸ‘‰ Together, these two works reflect my dual focus: pushing the boundaries of AI cognition and applying data-driven intelligence to real-world decision-making.
