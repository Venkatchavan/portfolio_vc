Title: The Pitch of Our Past
Content: We played beneath the dusky skies,
With broken bats and dreaming eyes.
A taped-up ball, a field of dust,
And rules we bent in boyhood trust.

We laughed, we fought, we called each name,
Each match, a legend, not just a game.
From one old street, we grew apart,
But stitched the same within the heart.

Now scattered wide, our lives unfold,
But when we meetâ€”the past is gold.
For jokes revive and time stands still,
That bond of youth forever will.
