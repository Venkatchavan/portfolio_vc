Title: Footprints in the Snow
Content: The snow first fell—a silver dream,
A wonderland in silent gleam.
I stepped alone on frozen streets,
And found in stillness, quiet beats.

With bare feet pressed on icy stone,
I met myself, yet felt alone.
At markets bright with festive cheer,
I smiled through joy and held back fear.

The lights, the cold, the world so wide,
Yet something empty stayed inside.
When New Year rang, I softly knew—
My heart was calling something true.

So I booked my flight and let tears show,
Still kissed the snow before I'd go.
Some winters hug, some winters bite,
But all must pass into the light.
