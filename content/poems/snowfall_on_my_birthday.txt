Title: Snowfall on My Birthday
Content: No candles lit, no crowded cheer,
Just frost and silence drawing near.
In foreign lands, my heart did sway,
A birthday dawned—a quiet day.

No calls, no cake, no bursting sound,
Just snowflakes spinning on the ground.
I laughed, I wept, I stood alone,
And found a truth I now call my own:

That joy and sorrow ebb and flow,
Like drifting snow, like winds that blow.
And even if no one may see—
I celebrate the strength in me.
