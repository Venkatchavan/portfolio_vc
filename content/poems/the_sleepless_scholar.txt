Title: The Sleepless Scholar
Content: Once I napped at noon with ease,
Chasing dreams in gentle breeze.
Now I lie beneath the night,
Eyes wide open, far from light.

Five hours pass like whispered dust,
Each breath heavy, laced with rust.
The mirror shows what silence hidesâ€”
Blackened eyes and faded strides.

Food feels foreign, thoughts run wild,
Hope lost somewhere in the piled.
But in this ache, a will survives,
A fire that still dares and strives.
