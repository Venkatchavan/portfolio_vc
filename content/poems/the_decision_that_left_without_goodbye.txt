Title: The Decision That Left Without Goodbye
Content: No voices weighed, no counsel sought,
Just one bold moment, a burning thought.
A ticket booked, a world unknown,
A journey I would walk alone.

Delays and doubts, the waiting spun,
The visa stalled, the loan undone.
But still I stood through fear and fire,
Fueled by quiet, growing desire.

I landed here, the skies so wide,
For three sweet days, I walked with pride.
Then came the ache, the silent cries—
Of missing hands and teary eyes.

Yet in that ache, I found my name,
In cooking flames and sweeping shame.
From solitude I shaped my core—
That one bold step became much more.
