Title: Two Days, A Thousand Moments
Content: In the golden breath of German skies,
Two days danced before our eyes.
An old 2 a.m. friend, still near, still true,
With roads that whispered, "It's just us two."

Deep talks that bent the edge of time,
Long walks in sync, a perfect rhyme.
Sunsets melting on Peacock Isle,
City scrapers watching us smile.

We spoke of past, of dreams ahead,
Of roads we'd walked, and words unsaid.
Sudden plans, the easy roasts,
The kind of joy a soul still boasts.

Two days may fade, the maps may partâ€”
But that connection lives in the heart.
