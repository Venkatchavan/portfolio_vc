Title: The Week After I Spoke
Content: I spoke the truth, heart on sleeve,
But heard a 'no' I couldn't grieve.
A week of silence, strange and still,
Yet duty called, and so did will.

Together we stood, not as I dreamed,
But sharper, calmer, so it seemed.
No love returned, yet strength was bornâ€”
We conquered doubts that Monday morn.
