Title: The Roasts We Lived By
Content: We once spoke flames with every line,
Sarcasm seasoned, raw, divine.
No feelings bruised, no hearts to mend,
Just friendly fire that knew no end.

We laughed so hard we lost our breath,
Insults that loved more than they death.
Comebacks sharp as cricket swings,
We ruled the art of teasing things.

But now the chats grow still and slow,
Life pulled us each where we must go.
Yet when I'm down or feeling small,
I hear those jokesâ€”and smile through all.
