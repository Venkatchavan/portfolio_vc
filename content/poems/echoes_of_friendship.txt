Title: Echoes of Friendship
Content: Seven stars once lit my skies,
Three moons with laughter in their eyes.
We danced through days, no need to say,
That hearts were close though miles away.

But now the winds grow still and strange,
The calls grow rare, the seasons change.
Yet trust, like roots, runs deep below,
Though time may pause, true bonds still grow.

I miss their voices, jokes and care,
Yet in my soul, they're always there.
This pause shall pass, the tides shall turn,
And fires of friendship once more burn.
